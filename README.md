# 📌 Real-Time-Face-Detection-Using-OpenCV


The objective of this PROJECT is to build a face detection system using **OpenCV in Python** by applying image processing techniques.

The project demonstrates face detection using the **Haar Cascade Classifier**, one of the most commonly used methods for detecting frontal human faces.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
- Capture video frames or images using OpenCV.
- Detect human faces using **Haar Cascade**.
- Draw bounding boxes around detected faces.
- Implement the solution using **Python and OpenCV**.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- Haar Cascade Classifier  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---


## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The Haar Cascade model is loaded using OpenCV.
2. An input image is converted to grayscale.
3. The classifier detects faces in the image.
4. Rectangles are drawn around detected faces.
5. The final output displays the detected face(s).

---

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python matplotlib
Open the Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Run all cells in face_detection.ipynb.

---

✅ Output
Faces in the image are detected successfully.

Detected faces are highlighted using a green rectangular box.

---

📌 Note
The project follows the structure and guidelines discussed during the OpenCV session.

The implementation focuses on face detection using Haar Cascade .

---

🏁 Conclusion
This project demonstrates a basic yet effective implementation of face detection using OpenCV.
It provides hands-on experience with image processing and real-world computer vision techniques.
